Hi there,

My name is Nelson, and I'm a web developer from Lisbon, Portugal, working since 2011.

Worked as a full-stack developer for a while (back in the days of jQuery and PHP), but I've always been more attracted to the visual side of things and switched to frontend full-time since late 2017.

I like to try new things, be it programming languages, libraries, or just playing with random ideas. I have a tendency to move quickly between things, hence the name of this blog.

The goal for this blog is to be a place where I can share whatever interests me at the present moment.

Hope you enjoy your stay. :)
